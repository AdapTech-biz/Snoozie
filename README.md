# Snoozie
## The Alarm That Sets Itself!
Never be concern about setting your alarm clock for the right time. 
Snoozie takes the guess work out of planning for traffic accident or road construction.
Just simply set your destination and your desired arrival time and let **Snoozie** handle the rest!

## Self-Adapting
Once you set your destination and desired arrival time **Snoozie** routinely checks the traffic report to see if
the travel time changed since the alarm was oringinally set. If the travel time has become longer due to construction or accidents,
**Snoozie** will adjust your alarm time so you still arrive at your desired time. And of course if the traffic reports indicates a smooth ride, **Snoozie** will push your alarm back for you. Allowing you to catch a few more Zzz's before starting your day!

## Auto-complete Address Search
